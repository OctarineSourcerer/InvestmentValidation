The other crucial thing of course is that the objective is rewarding - an upgrade, a new item, a bit of narrative that you otherwise wouldn't see, all those things can of course make for an appealing objective.","Some simple objectives I would describe as mundanely as a satisfying errand, one that I can complete with a certain degree of proceduralness, which I often find relaxing. Other, more world-building objectives I would describe as high stakes, emotional (say, for example, escaping the underworld in Hades), and well-justified by the plot.","I think that despite playing the first tutorial, I wasn't familiar enough to truly grasp the stakes - I still am confused about what, if anything, of the ritual I saw. The blue mages were going off to do their own thing, but they seemed to be friendly so I left them alone and focused on clearing the enemies because I thought then I'd be able to find the ritual no problem. Unfortunately I let my hero get killed like an idiot on turn ~6 so I maybe didn't get to see where it was headed. "

After I have planned a clear path, I feel powerful while enacting that path.",I felt cheated because I lost a lot of units defending the mages. This being caused by them playing too aggressively. This caused me to be unable to kill the mages after the ritual went critical. I find this frustrating.
